    "## Summary and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "This evaluation notebook provides a comprehensive assessment of the Questionnaire Agent's performance across multiple dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Evaluation Measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Relevance**: How relevant and on-topic the responses are to the input queries\n",
    "2. **Coherence**: How logically structured and internally consistent the responses are\n",
    "3. **Fluency**: How well-written, readable, and linguistically sound the responses are\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Azure AI Queries**: Tests the agent's knowledge and accuracy on its primary domain\n",
    "- **General Queries**: Tests the agent's ability to stay on topic and handle off-domain questions appropriately\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Objective Assessment**: Uses AI-assisted evaluation for consistent, scalable assessment\n",
    "- **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Evaluates different aspects of response quality\n",
    "- **Azure Integration**: Results are available in Azure AI Foundry Studio for detailed analysis\n",
    "- **Reproducible**: Can be run repeatedly to track improvements over time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
