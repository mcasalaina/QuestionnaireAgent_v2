class FoundryAgentSession:
    """
    Context manager for managing Foundry agent and thread resources.
    
    This class implements the context manager protocol to safely create
    and clean up Foundry agent and thread resources. It ensures that
    resources are always cleaned up, even if exceptions occur during
    the session.
    
    The __enter__ method creates an agent and a thread, returning both
    IDs (or full objects). The __exit__ method always attempts to delete
    the agent and thread, swallowing/logging any deletion errors so they
    don't mask the original exception.
    
    Example:
        Basic usage with resource cleanup:
        
        >>> with FoundryAgentSession(client) as (agent, thread):
        ...     # Use agent and thread for operations
        ...     result = agent.run_task(thread.id, "some task")
        ...     # Resources are automatically cleaned up
        
        Even if an exception occurs, resources are cleaned up:
        
        >>> try:
        ...     with FoundryAgentSession(client) as (agent, thread):
        ...         # Some operation that might fail
        ...         raise ValueError("Something went wrong")
        ... except ValueError:
        ...     # Agent and thread are still cleaned up
        ...     pass
